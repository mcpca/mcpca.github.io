# Miguel Aguiar

I am a doctoral student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology supervised by Karl Henrik Johansson,
João Sousa (University of Porto) and Amritam Das (TU Eindhoven).

I'm broadly interested in scientific machine learning for control, and in particular the interaction
between system-theoretical properties and learning, as well as applications of differentiable
surrogate modelling in control systems.

Previously, I was a researcher and software engineer at LSTS in Porto, Portugal, where I worked
mainly on trajectory optimisation and control for autonomous underwater vehicles.

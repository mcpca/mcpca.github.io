## marlin
[Code](https://github.com/mcpca/marlin) | [Related publication](/academia/preprints/2019-oceans.pdf)

A numerical solver for first-order static Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations.
Written in C++ with OpenMP for parallel operations.
See [my M.Sc. thesis](/academia/msc_thesis.pdf) for implementation details.

## semble
[Code](https://github.com/mcpca/semble)

A small Python library for simulating control systems.
System trajectories are represented as probability distributions described by simple configuration
files, making it easy to reproducibly generate trajectory datasets.
